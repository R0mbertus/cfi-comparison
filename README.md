Repo containing all the code relevant to my bachelor thesis on comparing forward-edge control-flow integrity.

# Structure
`docker`   - All the docker files needed to build containers for the policies  
`eval`     - Different directories for toolings used to evaluate policies  
`policies` - The policies that were compared that needed to be built. `custom/` has policies implemented by me using LLVM
